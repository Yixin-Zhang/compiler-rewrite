*****************************************************************************
NOTE: We put our llvm source code under user home directory (in Makefile we
have LLVMPATH=~/llvm, if your LLVM is in different directories, please change
it accordingly:
1. If your llvm is installed in your system include directories, e.g.
/usr/include etc. You can remove the -I option when compiling using g++)
2. If you also manually installed your llvm, please specify your llvm include
path using LLVMPATH in Makefile.

We used Bison & Flex to generate our parser and the environment is Mac OS X.

To generate the parser, simply run 'make' or 'make parser'.

To use the parser to parse your source file, run:
./parser source-file [ -o1 outputfile1] [-emit-ast] [-o2 outputfile2]

When -o1 option is used, the AST will be output to 'outputfile1' in YAML format.
When only -emit-ast option is used, AST will be printed to standard output.
If not options specified, the parser will silently parse the source and check
any syntax errors, and won't print the output.
When -o2 option is used, the CodeGen will be output to 'outputfile2'.

Run "make clean" to clean up the intermediate files generated.

We tried our best to make a complete compiler, however, for this assignment, we
still didn't finish 3 things:
1. If statement
2. While statement
3. Things related to noalias
