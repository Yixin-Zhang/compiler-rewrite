We used Bison & Flex to generate our parser and the environment is Mac OS X.

To generate the parser, run "make kale".

To use kale to parse your input, please run "./kale -emit-ast -o outputfile.txt inputfile.txt".
In this example, test1.ek is a sample input for testing.

To clear the files it generate, please run "make clean".
